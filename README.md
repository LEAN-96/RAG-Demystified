# Fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs):

Large Language Models (LLMs) are not just static tools but exhibit remarkable emergent abilities. When we talk about emergent abilities we're referring to the unexpected talents or skills these models demonstrate as they interact with users or tasks. These capabilities can sometimes surprise us, showing functionalities that weren't explicitly programmed into the model. LLMs demonstrate various emergent abilities, such as instruction following, in-context learning and step-by-step reasoning. These capabilities include problem-solving, where LLMs provide insightful solutions to tasks they weren't trained on, adaptation to user inputs, and contextual understanding.

LLMs perform well when given instructions during inference, and they excel when provided with contextual reference data. They prioritize contextual knowledge over data they've been trained on, leading to more accurate responses.

In-context learning is another important ability, allowing LLMs to refine their responses based on specific contexts. This enhances the relevance and coherence of their outputs.

The emergence of these abilities distinguishes LLMs from smaller models. For example, LLMs like GPT-3 exhibit strong in-context learning abilities, allowing them to generate expected outputs without additional training. They can also follow instructions for new tasks without explicit examples, improving their generalization ability.

Furthermore, LLMs can solve complex tasks involving multiple reasoning steps, such as mathematical word problems, through strategies like the chain-of-thought prompting. This ability, along with others, emerges as LLMs scale up in size, contributing to their performance gains. Overall, emergent abilities in LLMs showcase their adaptability and intelligence, making them versatile tools for various tasks and applications.

# Limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs):
Despite their impressive abilities, LLMs have notable limitations, especially when applied in real-world situations. One major issue is that they sometimes generate information that is incorrect or entirely made up, which is called "hallucination." This problem becomes worse when combined with issues like bias, user privacy concerns, and security risks.

Another important limitation is that LLMs have a fixed amount of knowledge (Parametric memory). They only know what they learned during their training and can't adapt to new information. This makes them less effective in tasks that require the latest and most detailed knowledge, especially in specialized areas. In practical terms, this might mean they produce irrelevant or even harmful content, which can be expensive to correct.

Additionally, LLMs have technical restrictions, such as limits on the amount of text they can process at once (Token limits). This can affect their ability to handle large blocks of text and may make it harder to scale their use for bigger projects. 

# Introduction to RAG:

![RAG_Origin_Terms_Heatmap](https://github.com/LEAN-96/RAG-Demystified/assets/150592634/83d8af41-cc3d-47da-87da-24cda82c1c44)



To address these limitations, the field of AI has introduced a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG was first introduced by [Lewis et. al](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) in 2020. The authors introduced RAG as a novel approach to natural language processing (NLP) tasks that require access to external knowledge sources (Non-parametric knowledge). RAG builds upon the advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, integrating retrieval-based methods to enhance the generation process and to overcome the fixed amount of knowledge (Parametric knowledge).

Let's explore RAG through the analogy of a student attending an exam:
Think of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) as a closed-book exam where the student relies solely on their memorized knowledge without referring to any materials. They're expected to answer questions based on what they've learned beforehand.

Now, picture RAG as an open-book exam for the same student, but with a twist: they haven't studied! In this scenario, the student can access a textbook during the exam, similar to how RAG integrates an external knowledge base with the language model. 

In essence, RAG is like an open-book exam without studying, where the student (or the model) can access additional resources but must still navigate through them to find the correct information, while pre-trained LLMs are more like closed-book exams where the model can only use what it already knows.

![RAG_Analogy](https://github.com/LEAN-96/RAG-Demystified/assets/150592634/92b40321-be9d-44c0-9c25-96900ad67ef4)


Understanding RAG begins with grasping the main ideas of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in NLP. RAG works similarly to a typical sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, where it takes one sequence as input and produces a corresponding sequence as output. Generation-based models in an traditional seq2seq model  focus on creating text solely based on the input without looking at external sources. However, what sets RAG apart is that it adds an extra step. Instead of directly sending the input to the generator, RAG uses retrieval-based methods, which involve finding useful information from outside sources, like databases or existing texts, to help with generating text. RAG combines these two methods by using a retriever component (dense passage retriever) to find relevant context from external sources and a generator component (seq2seq model) to produce text based on both the input and retrieved context.

By doing this, RAG improves the quality of the text generated by the model and ensures that it's accurate and up-to-date. This approach also helps to reduce the problem of generating incorrect information, known as "hallucinations," by making the model rely on existing documentation.

Additionally, RAG enhances transparency and helps with error checking and copyright issues by clearly citing the sources of information used in the generated text. It also allows for private or specialized data to be incorporated into the text, ensuring that the output is tailored to specific needs or is more current.

One advantage is its ability to reduce the need for frequent retraining (fine-tuning) of the model. Unlike traditional approaches, where the entire model must be retrained with new documents to change what it knows, RAG simplifies this process. By updating the external database with new information, RAG eliminates the need for the model to memorize everything, saving time and computational resources. This flexibility allows us to control what the model knows simply by swapping out the documents used for knowledge retrieval.

# Naive RAG

**High-Level RAG Architecture:**
![RAG-Architecture2](https://github.com/LEAN-96/RAG-Demystified/assets/150592634/b944dc68-dfa0-4801-b65e-41f4d105d2ad)

The basic RAG process involves indexing, retrieval, and generation. In simple terms, a user's input is used to search for relevant documents, which are then combined with a prompt and given to the model to create a final response. If the interaction involves multiple turns, previous conversation history can be included in the prompt. The entire RAG-Process is often referred as "RAG-Pipeline".

However, this approach, known as Naive RAG, has some drawbacks. It may suffer from low precision, meaning it sometimes includes irrelevant information in the response, and low recall, where it may miss relevant information. Another issue is the possibility of the model receiving outdated information, leading to inaccurate responses and the risk of generating content that doesn't align with the user's needs. This can result in confusing or incorrect answers.

## Indexing:
Transforming unstructured data into a format that AI models can efficiently process is a key step in setting up RAG. Therefore, Indexing is a crucial step in preparing data. It involves several key steps:

1. Data Transformation: We start by getting our data ready. This involves cleaning up and extracting information from different formats like PDFs or web pages. Then, we make sure everything is in a standard text format that the model can understand.

2. Chunking: Next, we break the text into smaller pieces, kind of like cutting a big cake into slices. This helps the model handle the information better, especially since it can only process a certain amount at a time (Limited context window). Chunk size plays a role in how our system understands information. When a chunk contains multiple ideas, the semantic relationship based on the whole chunk might not precisely show the importance of the main information. This could lead to confusion or inaccurate results.
Choosing a smaller chunk gives a clearer context, focusing on specific details. On the other hand, larger chunks include more information, but some of it might not be directly related to what the user is looking for. So, finding the right balance is key to getting accurate and relevant results.

3. Encoding and Vectorization: Now comes the tricky part: turning words into numbers! We use embedding models to do this, which help our computer understand the meaning behind the words and how they're related to each other. In other words the encoded text is transformed as high-dimensional vectors, capturing semantic information and relationships.

4. Storage in Vector Database: Finally, we store these encoded chunks in a vector database. This specialized database is designed to manage and search embedded vectors. This makes it easy for the retriever to find what it needs quickly when we ask it questions later on.

When it comes to seeing our index in action, we rely on a handy tool called [RAGmap](https://github.com/JGalego/RAGmap). RAGmap is a simple RAG visualization tool for exploring document chunks and queries in embedding space. It enables to create a vector store and reduces high-dimensional vectors to 2D and 3D vector space. For our embedding model, we opted for [BGE-Small](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) and indexed the original [RAG paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) to demonstrate how it works. Each chunk contains 256 tokens and a chunk overlap of 25 tokens. Here's what the visualization in a 2D spaces looks like:

A single, pre-trained language model","has been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench- marks\u003cbr\u003e[ 60,61] after ﬁne-tuning [ 49,8]. GPT-2 [ 50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-\u003cbr\u003etrained","language model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks. For\u003cbr\u003efurther improvement, BART [ 32] and T5 [ 51,52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder","model that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative and\u003cbr\u003egenerative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed","Generation: Answer QueryFigure 1: Overview of our approach. We combine a pre-trained retriever (\u003cbr\u003eQuery Encoder +Document Index ) with a pre-trained seq2seq model ( Generator ) and ﬁne-tune end-to-\u003cbr\u003eend. For query x, we use","architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\u003cbr\u003eLearned Retrieval There is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information","retrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [ 44,26] similar to ours. Some\u003cbr\u003ework optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering,","using search [ 46], reinforcement learning [ 6,63,62], or a latent variable approach [ 31,20] as in\u003cbr\u003eour work. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization\u003cbr\u003etechniques to","achieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based\u003cbr\u003earchitecture can be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks. Memory-based\u003cbr\u003eArchitectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for","neural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [ 64,55]. Concurrent work [ 14] learns to\u003cbr\u003eretrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in\u003cbr\u003eour","work. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\u003cbr\u003efact embeddings [ 15,13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather","distributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\u003cbr\u003einterpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the\u003cbr\u003emodel’s","memory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\u003cbr\u003edialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-\u003cbr\u003eIDF rather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].","Retrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\u003cbr\u003eapproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then\u003cbr\u003eedited","to provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\u003cbr\u003eMachine Translation [ 18,22] and Semantic Parsing [ 21]. Our approach does have several differences,","Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) to ﬁnd the top-K documents zi. For ﬁnal prediction y, we\u003cbr\u003etreatzas a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents.","including less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from\u003cbr\u003eseveral pieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence\u003cbr\u003edocuments","rather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and\u003cbr\u003ecould represent promising future work. 6 Discussion In this work, we presented hybrid generation\u003cbr\u003emodels with access to parametric and non-parametric","memory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We found\u003cbr\u003ethat people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual","and speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\u003cbr\u003eits effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model","without requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two\u003cbr\u003ecomponents can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to\u003cbr\u003eBART or some","another objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\u003cbr\u003ememories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\u003cbr\u003ewide variety of NLP tasks. 9","Broader Impact This work offers several positive societal beneﬁts over previous work: the fact that\u003cbr\u003eit is more strongly grounded in real factual knowledge (in this case Wikipedia) makes it\u003cbr\u003e“hallucinate” less","with generations that are more factual, and offers more control and interpretability. RAG could be\u003cbr\u003eemployed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct beneﬁt to society, for example by endowing it","with a medical index and asking it open-domain questions on that topic, or by helping people be more\u003cbr\u003eeffective at their jobs. With these advantages also come potential downsides: Wikipedia, or any\u003cbr\u003epotential external knowledge","source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias. Since RAG can be\u003cbr\u003eemployed as a language model, similar concerns as for GPT-2 [ 50] are valid here, although arguably","but have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric\u003cbr\u003eand non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.","to a lesser extent, including that it might be used to generate abuse, faked or misleading content\u003cbr\u003ein the news or on social media; to impersonate others; or to automate the production of\u003cbr\u003espam\u002fphishing","content [ 54]. Advanced language models may also lead to the automation of various jobs in the\u003cbr\u003ecoming decades [ 16]. In order to mitigate these risks, AI systems could be employed to ﬁght against\u003cbr\u003emisleading content and automated spam\u002fphishing.","Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive\u003cbr\u003efeedback on this paper, as well as HuggingFace for their help in open-sourcing code to run RAG\u003cbr\u003emodels.

For RAG, we also\u003cbr\u003emake use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training","the model with each (q;a)pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy.

The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks.

FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia as\u003cbr\u003eevidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to","us, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work. F\u003cbr\u003eNull Document Probabilities We experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to\u003cbr\u003eREALM [ 20] in order","to model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, if kdocuments\u003cbr\u003ewere retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null","as additional context when generating the target sequence y. As shown in Figure 1, our models\u003cbr\u003eleverage two components: (i) a retriever p\u0011(zjx)with parameters \u0011that returns (top-K truncated)","document, before marginalizing over k+ 1predictions. We explored modelling this null document logit\u003cbr\u003eby learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or","(iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in\u003cbr\u003ethe interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents","cannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of\u003cbr\u003edocuments for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document\u003cbr\u003emechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.

DPR follows a bi-encoder\u003cbr\u003earchitecture: p\u0011(zjx)\u002fexp\u0000 d(z)\u003eq(x)\u0001 d(z) =BERTd(z);q(x) =BERTq(x)","where d(z)is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERT BASE document encoder [8],\u003cbr\u003eandq(x)a query representation produced by a query encoder , also based on BERT BASE.

We use","a pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This\u003cbr\u003eretriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [ 24] questions and","ory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained\u003cbr\u003eseq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a\u003cbr\u003epre-trained neural retriever. We com-","Natural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory . 2.3 Generator:\u003cbr\u003eBART The generator component p\u0012(yijx;z;y 1:i\u00001)could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use","BART-large [ 32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [ 58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input\u003cbr\u003exwith the retrieved content zwhen generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was","pre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has\u003cbr\u003eobtained state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-\u003cbr\u003esized T5","models [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters \u0012as the parametric memory henceforth. 2.4\u003cbr\u003eTraining We jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on\u003cbr\u003ewhat","document should be retrieved.

Instead, we run beam search for","pare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole\u003cbr\u003egenerated sequence, and another which can use different passages per token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate\u003cbr\u003eour models on a wide range of knowledge-","each document z, scoring each hypothesis using p\u0012(yijx;z;y 1:i\u00001). This yields a set of hypotheses\u003cbr\u003eY, some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability","of an hypothesis ywe run an additional forward pass for each document zfor whichydoes not appear in\u003cbr\u003ethe beam, multiply generator probability with p\u0011(zjx)and then sum the probabilities across","beams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer\u003cbr\u003eoutput sequences,jYjcan become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding,","we can make a further approximation that p\u0012(yjx;zi)\u00190whereywas not generated during beam search from\u003cbr\u003ex;zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Yhas","been generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.” 3 Experiments We experiment\u003cbr\u003ewith RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use","a single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and\u003cbr\u003eKarpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint","100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an\u003cbr\u003eembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [ 23] with a Hierarchical","Navigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [ 37]. During training, we retrieve the top\u003cbr\u003ekdocuments for each query. We consider k2f5;10gfor training and set kfor test time using dev data.\u003cbr\u003eWe now discuss experimental details for each task.","3.1 Open-domain Question Answering Open-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world\u003cbr\u003eapplication and common testbed for knowledge-intensive tasks [ 20]. We treat questions and answers\u003cbr\u003eas input-output text pairs (x;y)","and train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to the\u003cbr\u003epopular extractive QA paradigm [ 5,7,31,26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved","intensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming\u003cbr\u003eparametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language\u003cbr\u003egeneration tasks, we ﬁnd that RAG models generate","documents, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book QA”\u003cbr\u003eapproaches [ 52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead","relying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\u003cbr\u003eQuestions (NQ) [ 29], TriviaQA (TQA) [ 24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [ 3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [ 2]. As","CT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [ 26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG model. We\u003cbr\u003euse the same train\u002fdev\u002ftest splits as prior work [ 31,26] and report Exact Match (EM)","scores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set. 3.2 Abstractive\u003cbr\u003eQuestion Answering RAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-\u003cbr\u003eform, abstractive","text generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\u003cbr\u003ewe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [ 43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages","retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the\u003cbr\u003eretrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat 4","MSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be answered in\u003cbr\u003ea way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as","“What is the weather in V olcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages. We\u003cbr\u003ealso note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here,","RAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses. 3.3 Jeopardy Question\u003cbr\u003eGeneration To evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question\u003cbr\u003egen-","eration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist of\u003cbr\u003eshort, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.","more speciﬁc, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.\u003cbr\u003e1 Introduction Pre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of\u003cbr\u003ein-depth knowl-","Jeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that\u003cbr\u003eentity. For example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the\u003cbr\u003eﬁrst","country to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise,\u003cbr\u003efactual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a\u003cbr\u003echallenging knowledge-intensive generation task.","We use the splits from SearchQA [ 10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As this is a\u003cbr\u003enew task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [ 67], we evaluate using the","SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [ 42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for matching\u003cbr\u003eentities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than","standard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\u003cbr\u003eone for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted\u003cbr\u003eexternal","sources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [ 33]. We follow best\u003cbr\u003epractice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [ 34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two","generated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\u003cbr\u003eoptions—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good. 3.4 Fact\u003cbr\u003eVeriﬁcation","3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation FEVER [ 56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported\u003cbr\u003eor refuted by Wikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires\u003cbr\u003eretrieving","evidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\u003cbr\u003ewhether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem","coupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\u003cbr\u003eexploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER","edge from data [ 47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\u003cbr\u003eimplicit knowledge base [ 51,52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-","class labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\u003cbr\u003eclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on","retrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available,\u003cbr\u003eand models that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We\u003cbr\u003eexplore","two variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports\u002frefutes\u002fnot enough info) and the 2-way\u003cbr\u003e(supports\u002frefutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\u003cbr\u003e4 Results 4.1 Open-domain Question Answering","Table 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA tasks,\u003cbr\u003eRAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines","the generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of\u003cbr\u003e\"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results","without expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [ 20]. It is worth noting that\u003cbr\u003eRAG’s retriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural\u003cbr\u003eQuestions","and TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross- encoder”\u003cbr\u003eto re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a","re-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance. There are several\u003cbr\u003eadvantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them.

## Generation: 
RAG uses a method called late fusion to combine information from all the documents it finds. It first predicts answers for each pair of document and question. Late fusion means that it combines all these predictions to come up with a final answer. This method is beneficial because it helps improve the overall performance of the system by allowing it to learn from its mistakes and correct them.

# Advanced RAG

Referencing back to our initial example of an student however, just like the student faces the challenge of finding the right answers amidst the sea of information in the textbook, Naive RAG may struggle to discern which information is relevant.

# Modular RAG

Recent studies shows the shift towards visual RAG approaches.
