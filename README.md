# Fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs):


# Limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs):
Despite their impressive abilities, LLMs have notable limitations, especially when applied in real-world situations. One major issue is that they sometimes generate information that is incorrect or entirely made up, which is called "hallucination." This problem becomes worse when combined with issues like bias, user privacy concerns, and security risks.

Another important limitation is that LLMs have a fixed amount of knowledge (Parametric memory). They only know what they learned during their training and can't adapt to new information. This makes them less effective in tasks that require the latest and most detailed knowledge, especially in specialized areas. In practical terms, this might mean they produce irrelevant or even harmful content, which can be expensive to correct.

Additionally, LLMs have technical restrictions, such as limits on the amount of text they can process at once (Token limits). This can affect their ability to handle large blocks of text and may make it harder to scale their use for bigger projects. 

# Introduction to RAG:

To address these limitations, the field of AI has introduced a new approach called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG was first introduced by [Lewis et. al](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) in 2020. The authors introduced RAG as a novel approach to natural language processing (NLP) tasks that require access to external knowledge sources (Non-parametric knowledge). RAG builds upon the advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, integrating retrieval-based methods to enhance the generation process and to overcome the fixed amount of knowledge (Parametric knowledge).

For beginners, understanding RAG starts with grasping the core concepts of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in NLP. Retrieval-based methods involve retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources, such as databases or pre-existing texts, to inform the generation process. On the other hand, generation-based methods focus on generating text based solely on the input prompt without explicit access to external knowledge.

RAG combines these two approaches by incorporating a retriever component that retrieves relevant context from external knowledge sources and a generator component that generates text conditioned on both the input prompt and the retrieved context. By doing this, RAG improves the quality of the text generated by the model and ensures that it's accurate and up-to-date. This approach also helps to reduce the problem of generating incorrect information, known as "hallucinations," by making the model rely on existing documentation.

Additionally, RAG enhances transparency and helps with error checking and copyright issues by clearly citing the sources of information used in the generated text. It also allows for private or specialized data to be incorporated into the text, ensuring that the output is tailored to specific needs or is more current.

One of the significant advantages of RAG is that it reduces the need for frequent retraining (fine-tuning) of the model. This is because the external database is continuously updated with new information, eliminating the reliance on the model to memorize everything it needs to know. This saves time and computational resources, making RAG a more efficient and reliable approach for generating text.
